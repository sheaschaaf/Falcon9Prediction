# Falcon9Prediction
This repository is a collection of notebooks used to predict the success of a Falcon9 launch. 

Project background and context
With a new company SpaceY, we want to determine its ability to compete with SpaceX. 
The purpose of this project is to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. On the SpaceX website, the Falcon 9 rocket costs 62 million dollars. Typically, it can cost up to 165 million dollars but SpaceX can reuse its first stage, making it more economically efficient. If we can determine whether the stage will land, we can determine the cost of the launch. This can be very valuable information to competitors of SpaceX. 

Problems we want answers to:
What are the valuable and important characteristics of a successful or failed landing?
How do the rocket variables affect the success or failure of a landing?
Which conditions will help SpaceX achieve its best landing success rate?
